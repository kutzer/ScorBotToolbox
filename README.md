# ScorBotToolbox
ScorBot Toolbox for MATLAB

This toolbox interfaces and simulates the Intelitek ScorBot-ER 4U with MATLAB. The toolbox allows users to control ScorBot, to acquire sensor information from ScorBot and to visualize aspects of ScorBot's movements. This download includes an install file to create the toolbox and add paths as needed. All toolbox functions include extensive help documentation, error checking, and visualization tools. 

## First Time Installation Instructions
1. Download, unzip, and install the [Intelitek RoboCell/ScorBase software](https://downloads.intelitek.com/Software/Robotics/ER-4u/)
   - Use the "Robocell_Scorbase_Setup_2020 B2.exe" download,
   - Run "Robocell_Scorbase_Setup_2020 B2.exe," and
   - Select SCORBASE ER4u when promoted.
2. Download "[ScorBotToolbox.zip](https://github.com/kutzer/ScorBotToolbox/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)" (or alternate version)
3. Unzip "ScorBotToolbox.zip"
4. Open MATLAB as an administrator
5. Change your MATLAB Current Directory to the location containing contents of the unzipped ScorBotToolbox
6. Run "installScorBotToolbox"
7. Move "ScorBotToolbox Example SCRIPTS" to a location of your choosing (optional)

## Update Instructions
